			The war started off conventional, although still destructive, with nuclear weapons being saved only as a last resort, but as major world powers found
			themselves getting into a more desperate position during the twilight years of the war, a brief but powerful nuclear exchange destroyed any remaining
			vestiges of governments, and with it ended human civilization as we know it.
			Gradually, the survivors began to rebuild civilization. Although facing oppostion from the forces of nature, disease, and even gangs of hostile survivors, armed with the surviving technology and knowledge from Before the War, these pockets of humanity flourished and with courage and spirit led humanity into a Brave New World. Cities that had once been burning piles of rubble began being rebuilt. Art and science were given new life. Governments sprang up, giving a degree of order to this New Civilization. Peace and prosperity had finally returned to the world.
